# Hamim Choudhury - Old Portfolio Project


### Project Recap

This is my old portfolio that I had made. This portfolio highlights the current projects I am working on, projects that I have completed, my work experience, 
and my tech stack. This portfolio also includes my social media links (GitHub,LinkedIn), contact information, and my resume. This website is not fully responsive
and is not properly able to be viewed across different devices, hence why I scrapped this project and created another version of my portfolio. For an updated version
of my portfolio, check out https://github.com/hamim23z/OfficialPortfolio_v2
